# AWS Security, Identity, Compliance, and Storage for Generative AI Exam Study Notes

This comprehensive guide covers AWS security, identity management, compliance, and storage services critical for protecting and managing generative AI workloads.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

## Security, Identity, and Compliance

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Foundation service for securely controlling access to AWS resources through authentication and authorization.[7][8]

**Core Concepts:**
- **Users**: Individual people or services with credentials (password, access keys)
- **Groups**: Collections of users sharing same permissions
- **Roles**: Temporary credentials assumed by users, services, or applications
- **Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions (allow/deny actions on resources)

**IAM Policy Structure:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModel",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {"aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"}
    }
  }]
}
```

**AI/ML IAM Best Practices:**
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant only permissions required for specific tasks[8]
- Use IAM roles for SageMaker notebooks/training jobs instead of embedding access keys
- Create service-specific policies: `SageMakerFullAccess`, `BedrockUserPolicy`, `S3ReadOnlyForMLData`
- Implement resource-based policies to restrict access to specific models or endpoints
- Use permission boundaries to set maximum permissions for delegated administrators

**Common IAM Policies for AI/ML:**
- **Data Scientists**: Read S3 training data, execute SageMaker training jobs, deploy models
- **ML Engineers**: Full SageMaker access, manage model registry, configure endpoints
- **Application Developers**: Invoke Bedrock APIs, call SageMaker endpoints, read-only access to models
- **Auditors**: CloudTrail read access, CloudWatch logs access, read-only IAM permissions

**IAM Roles for Services:**
- SageMaker execution roles: Access S3 buckets, write CloudWatch logs, access KMS keys
- Lambda execution roles: Invoke Bedrock, call SageMaker endpoints, read Secrets Manager
- Bedrock service roles: Access S3 for Knowledge Bases, OpenSearch Serverless for vector stores

**Policy Evaluation Logic:**
1. Explicit Deny → Overrides everything
2. Explicit Allow → Permitted if no deny exists
3. Implicit Deny → Default for all actions not explicitly allowed

- **Feature Store**: Archive historical feature sets to Standard-IA (180 days)

**Rule Configuration:**
- **Scope**: Apply to entire bucket, prefix, or object tags
- **Filters**: Combine prefix and tag filters for precise targeting
- **Versioning Support**: Separate rules for current vs non-current versions

**Example Lifecycle Policy:**
```json
{
  "Rules": [{
    "Id": "ArchiveTrainingData",
    "Filter": {"Prefix": "training-data/"},
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "Transitions": [
      {"Days": 90, "StorageClass": "GLACIER"},
      {"Days": 365, "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"}
    ],
    "Expiration": {"Days": 2555}
  }]
}
```

# AWS Application Integration, Compute, Containers, and Customer Engagement for Generative AI Exam Study Notes

This comprehensive guide covers AWS application integration, compute, container, and customer engagement services critical for building, deploying, and orchestrating generative AI applications.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

## Application Integration Services

### AWS Step Functions
Serverless workflow orchestration service for coordinating distributed applications and microservices.[8][2][3][1]

**Core Capabilities:**
- Visual workflow designer (Workflow Studio) for building state machines[9]
- Coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows
- Built-in error handling, retries, and state management[3]
- Standard workflows (long-running, exactly-once execution) and Express workflows (high-volume, at-least-once)
- Integration with 200+ AWS services including Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock, ECS, SNS, SQS[3]

**Workflow States:**[10]
- **Task**: Execute single unit of work (invoke Lambda, start SageMaker training job)
- **Choice**: Conditional branching based on input data
- **Parallel**: Execute multiple branches simultaneously
- **Map**: Dynamically iterate over array elements (process batch of images)
- **Wait**: Delay execution for specified time
- **Pass**: Transform input/output without performing work
- **Succeed/Fail**: Terminal states for workflow completion

**ML Workflow Orchestration:**[2][1][3]

**End-to-End ML Pipeline:**
```
Data Prep (Glue/SageMaker Processing) → Training (SageMaker) → Evaluation → 
Model Registry → Deployment → Monitoring → Conditional Retraining
```

**AutoML Workflow with AutoGluon:**[1]
1. **ProcessingStep**: Preprocess dataset using SageMaker Processing
2. **TrainingStep**: Train AutoGluon model on SageMaker
3. **Choice State**: Evaluate model accuracy threshold
4. **Deployment**: If accuracy > threshold, deploy to endpoint
5. **Notification**: Send SNS alert on completion

**Native SageMaker Integration:**[2]

- Built-in retry logic and error handling for each step

**Event-Driven ML Workflows:**[3]
- Trigger workflows based on S3 uploads (new training data arrives)
- Schedule periodic model retraining using EventBridge rules
- Respond to CloudWatch alarms (model drift detected → retrain pipeline)
- Integrate with external systems via API Gateway webhooks

**Dynamic Parallelism:**[8]
- Use Map state to process large datasets from S3 in parallel
- Distribute hyperparameter tuning across multiple concurrent training jobs
- Process batch inference requests concurrently with controlled concurrency limits
- Handle millions of concurrent executions with horizontal scaling[8]

**Best Practices:**
- Use Step Functions Data Science SDK for programmatic workflow creation[2]
- Implement Choice states for conditional model deployment based on metrics
- Add SNS notifications for workflow failures and completions
- Use Pass states to transform data between incompatible service formats
- Enable CloudWatch Logs for debugging workflow executions
- Design idempotent tasks to safely retry failed operations

### Amazon EventBridge
Serverless event bus for building event-driven architectures connecting AWS services and SaaS applications.[5][11][12][13]

**Core Components:**[11][12]
- **Event Buses**: Channels for routing events (default, custom, partner event buses)[12]
- **Events**: JSON objects representing state changes (S3 upload, model training complete)
- **Rules**: Filter and route events based on patterns to specific targets[11]
- **Targets**: AWS services receiving events (Lambda, Step Functions, SNS, SQS, Kinesis)[12]

**Event Pattern Matching:**[11]
```json
{
  "source": ["aws.sagemaker"],
  "detail-type": ["SageMaker Training Job State Change"],
  "detail": {
    "TrainingJobStatus": ["Completed"]
  }
}
```

**AI/ML Event-Driven Patterns:**

**Model Retraining Pipeline:**[14][13]
```
S3 (new data) → EventBridge → Glue Workflow → Feature Engineering → 
EventBridge → Step Functions → SageMaker Training
```

**Real-Time Analytics:**[13]
- Kinesis Data Streams → EventBridge → Lambda → Real-time feature updates
- S3 upload → EventBridge → Athena query → Dashboard refresh

**Model Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch Alarm (high error rate) → EventBridge → Step Functions (redeploy previous model version)
- SageMaker Model Monitor (drift detected) → EventBridge → SNS (alert data science team)

**Integration Capabilities:**[13]
- **AWS Service Events**: Automatically capture state changes from 90+ AWS services
- **Custom Events**: Publish application-specific events via PutEvents API
- **SaaS Integrations**: Receive events from Zendesk, Datadog, PagerDuty, Auth0

- **Schema Registry**: Define, discover, and validate event schemas[5]

**Best Practices:**
- Use custom event buses to isolate different application domains
- Implement event pattern filters to reduce unnecessary target invocations
- Enable CloudWatch Logs for all rules to debug event routing
- Archive important events for compliance and replay scenarios
- Use managed rules for AWS service integrations when available[13]

### Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
Fully managed pub/sub messaging service for distributing messages to multiple subscribers.

**Core Concepts:**
- **Topics**: Communication channels for publishing messages
- **Publishers**: Applications/services sending messages to topics
- **Subscribers**: Endpoints receiving messages (email, SMS, Lambda, SQS, HTTP/HTTPS, mobile push)
- **Message Filtering**: Route messages to specific subscribers based on attributes

**AI/ML Notification Use Cases:**
- Training job completion notifications to data science team (email, Slack via HTTP)
- Model deployment alerts to DevOps teams
- Inference error rate threshold breaches to on-call engineers
- Asynchronous inference completion notifications[6]
- Daily model performance reports via scheduled Lambda → SNS

**SNS + SQS Fan-Out Pattern:**
```
Lambda (inference) → SNS Topic → Multiple SQS Queues (logging, metrics, alerting)
```
Enables parallel processing of same message by multiple downstream systems.

**Message Attributes:**
```json
{
  "model_version": "v2.3",
  "accuracy": "0.95",
  "environment": "production"
}
```
Subscribers filter messages based on these attributes (e.g., only production alerts).

**Best Practices:**
- Use message filtering to reduce unnecessary deliveries and costs
- Enable server-side encryption for sensitive notifications
- Implement dead-letter queues for failed message deliveries
- Use FIFO topics for ordered notifications when sequence matters
- Configure retry policies and delivery status logging

### Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

**Queue Types:**
- **Standard**: Unlimited throughput, at-least-once delivery, best-effort ordering
- **FIFO**: Ordered delivery, exactly-once processing, limited to 3000 messages/sec

**AI/ML Queuing Patterns:**

**Asynchronous Inference Architecture:**[6][15]
```
Client → API Gateway → SQS → Lambda → SageMaker Endpoint → S3 (results) → SNS (notification)
```

**Benefits:**[15]
- Decouple API response from long-running inference (up to 1 hour)
- Built-in retries for failed inference requests
- Scale inference processing independently from API traffic
- Track messages with message IDs for status queries

**Batch Processing Pipeline:**
```
EventBridge (schedule) → Lambda (create tasks) → SQS → Lambda (workers) → 
Process batch predictions → DynamoDB (results)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Visibility Timeout**: Hide messages during processing to prevent duplicate processing (default 30 seconds)
- **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Capture messages that fail processing after max retries
- **Long Polling**: Reduce empty responses and costs by waiting for messages (1-20 seconds)[15]
- **Message Delay**: Postpone message delivery (0-15 minutes)
- **Message Retention**: Store messages 1 minute to 14 days (default 4 days)

**SageMaker Asynchronous Inference:**[6]
- SageMaker automatically creates internal queue for async requests
- Supports payloads up to 1GB and processing up to 1 hour
- Auto-scales to zero when no requests in queue (cost savings)
- Optional SNS notifications for success/failure[6]

**Best Practices:**
- Use FIFO queues when order matters (sequential model updates)
- Configure appropriate visibility timeout based on processing duration
- Implement exponential backoff for retries in consumer applications
- Monitor queue metrics (ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible, ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage)
- Use batching to receive/send up to 10 messages in single API call

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
    
    prompt = event['prompt']
    response = bedrock.invoke_model(
        modelId='anthropic.claude-v2',
        body=json.dumps({
            "prompt": f"\n\nHuman: {prompt}\n\nAssistant:",
            "max_tokens_to_sample": 300
        })
    )
    
    return json.loads(response['body'].read())
```

**SageMaker Endpoint Invocation:**[4]
```python
import boto3
import json

runtime = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(
        EndpointName='my-ml-model',
        ContentType='application/json',
        Body=json.dumps(event['input_data'])

# Store conversation history
cache.setex(
    f"session:{user_id}",
    3600,  # TTL: 1 hour
    json.dumps({
        "messages": [...],
        "context": {...},
        "model_version": "v2.3"
    })
)

# Retrieve session
session = json.loads(cache.get(f"session:{user_id}"))
```

# Cache expensive model predictions
cache_key = f"prediction:{input_hash}"
cached_result = cache.get(cache_key)

if cached_result:
    return json.loads(cached_result)
else:
    result = invoke_sagemaker_endpoint(input_data)
    cache.setex(cache_key, 3600, json.dumps(result))
    return result
```

**Feature Store Caching:**

**Architecture Patterns:**[5][12][13]
```
API Gateway → Lambda → ElastiCache (check cache) → 
  Cache Hit: Return cached result
  Cache Miss: Invoke ML endpoint → Update cache → Return result
```

**Session Store with Auto Scaling:**[13]
- ALB with sticky sessions routes requests to same instance
- ElastiCache Redis cluster shared across Auto Scaling Group instances[13]
- Session data persists regardless of which instance handles request
- Instances can be terminated without losing user sessions

**Best Practices:**
